# Analysis, detection & mitigation of felonious wallet accounts over the Ethereum blockchain network using Machine learning techniques
As of 2021, a survey from Coin Market Cap
indicates that there are nearly over 6,000 digital coins in the
market, a severe increase from just a handful since 2013.
However, a large portion of these cryptocurrencies might not
be that significant. The total market cap of all the crypto
assets, including stable coins and tokens has shown a
significant rise from year 2020 and has hit 2.4 trillion.
Cryptocurrencies has vast potential of revolutionizing and
transforming compliance-free peer-to-peer transactions.
However, an end user must overcome certain challenges
related to privacy, security, and control. As the transactions
are recorded in a publicly distributed ledger known as
blockchain, hackers have a large attack surface to gain access
to critical and sensitive data. In the rapidly growing crypto
currency space, the technological advent of cryptocurrencies
and their respective benefits has been veiled with several illicit
financing activities operating over the network such as
ransomware, terrorist financing, hacking, data manipulation
during transaction process, phishing, fraud, money laundering,
bribery etc. Chainalysis, a firm that tracks every crypto
currency transaction and serves as an advisor to an array of
government authorities has published a report that shows that
the amount of cryptocurrency spent on dark net markets rose
60% to reach a new high of $1.15billion from July 2020 to June
2021.

In this work, the primary focus is on the Ethereum network,
which has seen over 1373 billion transactions since its
inception. Propelled with the rise in use of machine learning
techniques in the research dimensions of financial domain, this
is an attempt to explore the possibility to use various machine
learning algorithms to analyze and detect the illicit accounts
using the transaction history. Many criminals don’t typically
transfer funds directly to and from their linked addresses when
transacting with regulated exchanges. A vast majority of bad
actors will move their funds at least one time. CipherTrace
analysts found that a typical cryptocurrency exchange’s dark
market exposure will typically double at two hops out
(transactions once removed from the exchange).
Various machine learning algorithms are evaluated on publicly
available accounts flagged by the Ethereum community for
their illegal activity coupled with valid accounts. A smart
contract deployed on the public blockchain network is further
used to track the illicit accounts, and hence proposed as a
possible mitigation technique for flagging suspicious wallet
addresses. External parties can query this smart contract to
validate a blacklisted account and enable the law enforcement
agencies take appropriate actions on the stolen coins/Ponzi
schemes. The proof of truth data on the blockchain ledger will
serve as a benchmark for future analysis.
